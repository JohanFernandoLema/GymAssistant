Steps for js file
1.- Create array with objects to be display in our DOM
2.- Load items with the DOMContentloaded property
3.- create a function with map property in order to access each item's property in the array list.
4.- Use template string to replace its content with the values accessed
5.- Use join property in order to place them together in one string.
6.- Display items in the html document by selecting the parent that is mainSection and passing the displayExercises to it.

1st part
//target the main section (where the items are going to be displayed)

const mainSection = document.querySelector('.main-section');

2//Retrieve the DOM (using DOMContentLoaded) when page is loaded
window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function(){
    3//Use map method in order to be able to modify our objects.
    let displayExercises = exercises.map(function(exercise){
        4//template string to be able to write html code in js
        //We start accessing the objects by each property.
        return `<article class="exercise-item">
        <img src=${exercise.img} alt="chest" class="graphic">
        <div class="exercise-info">
            <header>
                <h4>${exercise.name}</h4>
                <h4>${exercise.muscleTarget}</h4>
            </header>
            <h4>Exercise to add to your rutine</h4>
        </div>
    </article>`
    });
    5//Use join method to place the item together
    displayExercises = displayExercises.join('');
    6//Display items in the html document by selecting the parent that is mainSection and passing the displayExercises to it.
    mainSection.innerHTML = displayExercises;
    console.log(displayExercises);
});


7.- Create a function to store the display exercises, we do this in order to make easier at them moment of reading the code.
8.- Once the funtion is created its parameter will look for an arry in this case is our array with the objects.
